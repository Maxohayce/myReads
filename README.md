## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
---
git clone https://github.com/maxohayce/myreads.git myreads
cd myreads
npm install
npm start
```

### Usage

<!-- TODO: Update demo video link -->
<!-- Watch this short [demo video]() of how to use the app. -->

#### Important

This app uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](docs/SEARCH_TERMS.md).
That list of terms are the **_only_** terms that will work, so don't be surprised if your searches for _Basket Weaving_ or _Bubble Wrap_ don't come back with any results.

#### Issues

A browser console error of 404 when searching for books.
However, it doesn't affect the search results or app's functionality.
